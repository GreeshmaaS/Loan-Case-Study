# Loan-Case-Study
Mini Project for Data Analytics Internship </br></br>

Introduction </br>
This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
</br></br>


Business Objectives </br>
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

Data Understanding </br>

This dataset has 3 files as explained below: </br>

'application_data.csv' contains all the information of the client at the time of application. The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties.
'previous_application.csv' contains information about the clientâ€™s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.
'columns_description.csv' is data dictionary which describes the meaning of the variables.
